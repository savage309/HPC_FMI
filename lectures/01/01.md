<!-- Point that there is wide spread missleading information, that the law is
invalid (it will be probably in 10 years, it is not now). Intel/Samsung 14nm.

2. 16nm - TSMC (iPhone 6/6s), Samsung (iPhone 6/6s). GPUs in 2016 (why so late?)
3. 22nm - Intel (Haswell), GlobalFoundries, CNSE 
4. 28nm - TSMC (AMD GCN, nVidia Kepler, nVidia Maxwell)
5. ...

Нещо се случва през 2005

![Free Lunch Is Over](./images/free_lunch_is_over.png)

<!--multiple reasons for that to happen - power wall, ilp wall, memory wall. Smartphones with 10+ cores-->

Защо компютрите вече не стават по-бързи ?

* Не стават ли ?

* До преди 2005 - на всеки Х месеца броят на транзисторите се удвоява по закона
  на Мур

* Това се случва посредством намаляне на размера на транзистора на чипа двойно

* Когато чипът е два пъти по-малък можем да вдигнем честотата два пъти

**Frequency (f)** ~ `((V - Vth)^a) / V`
___
**Power** = **Dynamic Power** + **Static Power**
___
**Dynamic Power** - energy needed to switch gate ~ 
`Capactiance (C) * Voltage ^ 2 (V^2) * Frequency (F)`
___

**Static Power** - leakage of transistors while being inactive ~ `e^(-Vth)`


<font color="gray" size="1">For sake of simplicity, these calculations are simplified to show just the parts of them, which we care about and which make the difference in our case. If you feel like you need to know the full story, please check tu-sofia.bg</font>


<!--dynamic power is the power needed to change a transistor state. Before the leakage was negligable, is not like that today. Noise also get tough on such low voltage, due to effects caused by the wires (Shannon). Note that transistor by themselves are can not be "high performance" - they do not produce anything in the end of the day.-->

Straight forward:

4. Write-back

<!--start to explain how the processor works. Note that what we will show is more a mental model, since the modern processor is a bit more complicated. Point that the modern processor has more stages (12 to 30 or more) -->

---

Съществуват **точно 3 принципа**, приложими и извън програмирането, чрез които можем да получим по-голяма производителност

1. Работи по-усърдно / Work Harder

2. Работи по-умно / Work Smarter

3. Повикай помощ / Get Help

<!-- we have processor, it does what we want, now let's explore what are the ways to get more performance out of it -->

2. Кешове / branch prediction / out of order / etc

3. Multicore / ILP / Auto SIMD

Pipeline

Do the CPU phases in parallel - write back result, as executing something else,
as decoding 3rd, as fetching 4th ..

<img src="./images/pipeline2.svg" alt="lighterra.com" style="width: 685px;"/>

Какви проблеми може да създаде това ?
<!-- first - pipelining. Using all the stages at the same time makes the processor xN (where n = length of the pipe) faster. Different type of hazards however arise, like memory dependence, control flow hazad or structural (multiple instructions want to use the same hardware) -->


---

Resolving dependencies

```
       for (int i = 0; i < numItems; ++i) {
            x = y[i] * z;    /// <----
            q += z + x + x;
            x = a + b;       /// <----
        }

        //////////////

        for (int i =0 ; i < numItems; ++i) {
            float x0 = y[i] * z;
            q += z + x0 + x0;
            x = a + b;
        }
```
<!-- sneak peak at some of the very basic ways to resolve memory dependence. Point that the compiler most often does this for us. -->


---

Resolving dependencies in **reduction**
```
for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i)
    m = max(arr[i], m);
```
let's unroll ..
```
for (int i = 0; i <= size - 4; i+=4) {
    m = max(arr[i], m);
    m = max(arr[i+1], m); /// <----
    m = max(arr[i+2], m); /// <----
    m = max(arr[i+3], m); /// <----
}
```
Fixed:
```
m0=m1=m2=m3=-inf;
for (int i = 0; i <= size - 4; i+=4) {
    m0 = max(m0, arr[i+0]);
    m1 = max(m1, arr[i+1]);
    m2 = max(m2, arr[i+2]);
    m3 = max(m3, arr[i+3]);
}
m = max(m0, m1, m2, m3);
```
<!-- sneak peak at some of the very basic ways to resolve memory dependence. Point that the compiler most often does this for us. Some of the modern compiler can recognize reduction, unroll and vectorize for us. However, reductions are still tricky for the compilers, and it is not a bad idea to help them -->

---

let's assume we live in a perfect world, where CPUs are not power limited.

How fast can a CPU go ?

<!-- point that even if the power consumption wasn't such a problem, we still can't have the ultimate CPU. Point the difference between frequency and latency - you can send 100GHZ signal on the wire, but this doesn't change the latency of the signal -->

---

100ghz sounds fair

100ghz = 100 000 000 000 hz = 1e11hz -> 1e-11s (= 0.01ns)

Най-дългото разстояние, което може да бъде преминато за това време е 1е-11s * 300 000 km/s = 3mm

P.s. The maximal speed of electrons in Silicon is even lower - about 100 000 km/s, see 
[saturation velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_velocity).

---

## 3mm

Максималната честота е ограничена от скороста на най-бавният елемент в конвейра(пайплайна).

<!-- So know we know the difference between latency and frequency. Since each part of the pipeline has latency, the max frequency our CPU can go is 1/(theSlowestLatency). Otherwise at the same time we will need the hardware to do two different things. So we need to make the pipelines stages as small as we can -->

---

Superpipelined processors

<img src="./images/superpipelined.png" alt="lighterra.com" style="width: 685px;"/>

Какви проблеми може да създаде това ?

<!-- So, the stages are smaller and we can run faster and this is great. However this rises the ability for hazards a lot. Also, a stall becomes more and more expensive -->

---

ILP - Instruction Level Parallelism

Super scalar processors

"Широчина на процесор"

<img src="./images/superscalar.png" alt="lighterra.com" style="width: 685px;"/>

Какви проблеми може да създаде това ?

<!-- The other way to make it fast is to get help. The processor have multiplied (parts of) the pipeline. Like 2 integer ALUs for example. This is implicit parallelism - make your code faster without you having to do anything. The wider the processor, the harder is to find what to feed it, since the pipes have to do independend stuff. ILP in the recent years (like 2015) gets better and better (4%-8% per year). -->


---

Superpipelined Superscalar Processor

<img src="./images/superpipelinedsuperscalar.png" alt="lighterra.com" style="width: 685px;"/>

<!-- Point that each modern processor today is superpipelined and superscalar.
Since all of them are, it is often to not mention the "superpipelined" word. It
is often vendors to specify how wide the cores are. There could be different
processors, for example with 1 pipe for fetch/decode/store and multiple one for
execute. They can be combined in all kinds of ways, for example one of the
execution pipes can do only float&int calcs, the other can do branch only -->

Resolving dependencies compile time ...

* Structural dependencies

* Data dependencies

* Controll dependencies

<!-- Talk about how pricy it is to deal with all these hazards. Think about if we can resolve them compile time. Point that due to power consumptions vendors like to turn off parts of the chips, when they are not used. Most of the hardware dealing with those hazards can not be turned off, however -->

---

* Data dependencies detection is expensive.

* Black Silicon (N.B. **SILICON != SILICONE**)

* Out of order execution
 * Examing 100's of instructions 
 * Register renaming

<!-- At this point we have to see that we can't make processors faster, ILP
stops helping from some point due to memory hazards, bigger caches do not lead
to so much faster execution (we havent talked for caches, but we will in a few
slides).  -->

| Only dynamic power counts    | Static leakage is 40%      |
| Multiply is slow, load-and-store is fast | Memory wall      |
| ILP get better all the time, load-and-store is fast | ILP wall |
| Parallelization is not worth it | 75% per year before, 15% per year now    |
| Processor frequency goes up every X months | Number of cores goes up every X months      |
